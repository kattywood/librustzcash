# Changelog
All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

and this library adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Changes to batch decryption APIs:
  - The return types of `batch::try_note_decryption` and
    `batch::try_compact_note_decryption` have changed. Now, instead of
    returning entries corresponding to the cartesian product of the IVKs used for
    decryption with the outputs being decrypted, this now returns a vector of
    decryption results of the same length and in the same order as the `outputs`
    argument to the function. Each successful result includes the index of the
    entry in `ivks` used to decrypt the value.

### Changed
- MSRV is now 1.56.1.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-12-17
Initial release.
